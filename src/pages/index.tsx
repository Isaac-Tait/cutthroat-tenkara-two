              Well it has been awhile... Perhaps too long. I said I would bring
              back Cutthroat Tenkara if I could fish more than a few times a
              year.{' '}

            <p className='mt-2 text-sm text-gray-800'>
              Well that finally happened, after three long years of not enough
              fishing.

              Living in Southern California (San Diego) can be a bit depressing
              on the trout front. Long drives to high pressure water, drought
              conditions, epic poison oak, and high wild fire danger are just a
              few of the challenges.

              Of course the High Sierra are awesome, but it is at least a five
              hour drive north, which is kinda hard to swing for a day trip.

            <p className='mt-2 text-sm text-gray-800'>
              Well all that is behind me now because I moved to New England.
              Connecticut to be exact. The first month I lived here, I fished
              every day. Sometimes twice a day. It was awesome.
