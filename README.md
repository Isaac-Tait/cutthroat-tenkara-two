Cutthroat Tenkara was created to continue my affinity for blogging about fishing that all started with Fallfish Tenkara. However, it never quite took off. Until now... I guess... Okay maybe not. Whatever the logo is sweet and I cannot just let it sit on my hard drive as ones and zeros and not share it with the whole wide world... Are you impressed? Well if not you should be. Now go outside and do something cool before COVID-19 Delta Omicron Zeta Pie Alpha FYouWorld really throws us for a loop (us being human kind in general). Peace, love, and WWJD...
